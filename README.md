# ðŸ›« AirForceâ€‘ERPâ€‘DataBase

This project presents the design and development of a **relational database system** tailored for an **Air Force Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)** application. The system captures and manages various operational and personnel-related data across multiple functional areas including soldiers, medical records, aircrafts, missions, units, and awards.

## ðŸ”§ Key Contributions

- **Database Design**:  
  Created an optimized schema using 13 interrelated tables to support complex data relationships like soldier-to-mission, aircraft assignments, medical tracking, and dependent management.

- **ER Diagram & Relational Schema**:  
  Designed a complete ER diagram and converted it into a well-structured relational schema with appropriate primary and foreign keys.

- **Normalization**:  
  Performed normalization up to **Third Normal Form (3NF)** to eliminate data redundancy and ensure data integrity across all tables.

- **Functional Dependencies**:  
  Identified functional dependencies for every relation to support normalization and consistent data design.

- **SQL DDL & Sample Queries**:  
  Implemented full DDL scripts to create all tables and provided sample SQL queries to retrieve insights such as soldier assignments, mission history, and medical summaries.

- **Data Sample**:  
  Included sample data entries for demonstration and testing purposes.

This database can be foundational for any **military-grade ERP solution** focusing on centralized and scalable data management for defense operations.
